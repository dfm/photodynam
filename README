when using this code towards a publication.

Overview
--------

The code included in this package facilitates so-called "photometric-dynamical" modeling.  This model is quite simple and this is reflected in the code base.  A N-body code provides coordinates and the photometric code produces light curves based on coordinates.

The source code (in the directory source/) should be all one needs to produce forward model light curves. Briefly:

A. Pal's code to compute overlap integrals:
	elliptic.c
	elliptic.h
	icirc.c
	icirc.h
	mttr.c
	scpolyint.c
	scpolyint.h

This code forms the base of the photometric code.  When using that code alone or when using the full "photodynam" code please cite him appropriately:

	MNRAS (2012) 420 (2): 1630-1635. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.20151.x

n_body.cpp, n_body.h:
	This code performs the N-body integration with a Burlisch-Stoer integration scheme.  Refer to the header for the description of the simple function "evolve." Alternatively, use the NBodyState object to access the integrator.

n_body_state.cpp, n_body_state.h:
	Defines a class (containing public member functions and constructors) that retains a N-body "state" which is most simply the ICs and masses at some time.  You may operate on this object in a number of ways including N-body integration which is accomplished through the overloaded operator ().

n_body_lc.cpp, n_body.h:
	Contains code (relying on A. Pal's code, see above) to produce light curves (integrated light) for any number of spherical, quadratically limb-darkened bodies of arbitrary radius and flux. Will handle multiple overlaps ("mutual events").

kepcart.c:
	Matt Holman's code to covert between cartesian coordinates of Keplerian elements. (Matt, credit?)

photodynam.cpp:
	User-end code to produce light curves and other information for a standardized input format.  Easy to use, probably a good starting point to get some light curves produced.

Example use of functions
------------------------

#include "n_body_state.h"
#include "n_body_lc.h"

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {

	// Kepler-16

	int N = 3;
	double t0 = 212.12316;

	// Object properties (two stars and one planet) AU, day, radians

	double mass[N] = {0.00020335520,   5.977884E-05,   9.320397E-08}
	double radii[N] = {0.00301596700,   0.00104964500,   0.00035941463}
	double flux[N] = {0.98474961000,	0.01525038700,	0.00000000000}
	double u1[N] = {0.65139908000,	0.2,		0.0}
	double u2[N] = {0.00587581200,	0.3,		0.0}

	// Now, the N-1 Jacobian Keplerian elements

	double a[N-1] = {2.240546E-01,7.040813E-01}
	double e[N-1] = {1.595442E-01,7.893413E-03}
	double inc[N-1] = {1.576745E+00,1.571379E+00}
	double om[N-1] = {4.598385E+00,-5.374484E-01}
	double ln[N-1] = {0,-8.486496E-06}
	double ma[N-1] = {3.296652E+00,2.393066E+00}

	// Instantiate state.  Time t0 is epoch of above coordinates

	NBodyState state(mass,a,e,inc,om,ln,ma,N,t0);

	int status;
	double flux;

	// Evaluate the flux at time t0 using the getBaryLT() member method
	//	of NBodyState which returns NX3 array of barycentric, light-time
	//	corrected coordinates

	flux = occultn(state.getBaryLT(),radii,u1,u2,flux,N);

	// Now integrate forward in time to time t0+100 with stepsize 0.01 days orbit
	//	error tolerance of 1e-20 and minimum step size of 1e-10 days

	status = state(t0+100,0.01,1e-20,1e-10);

	// Now get the flux at the new time

	flux = occultn(state.getBaryLT(),radii,u1,u2,flux,N);

	// Print out the barycentric, light-time corrected x coordinate of body 0

	cout << state.X_LT(0) << endl;

	return 0;
}

// Refer to n_body_state.h for other access functions...

	Installing photodynam
	---------------------

	Unpack directory, change to that directory, type make. Program "photodynam" will be built
	in top directory

	Documentation
	-------------
	Call code as photodynam <input_file> <report_file> [> <output_file>].

	Output is written to standard out unless redirected (shown in the optional listing above).

	<input_file> file
	-----------------

  	<input_file> is file of initial coordinates and properties in
  	following format:

  	<N> <time0>
  	<step_size> <orbit_error>

  	<mass_1> <mass_2> ... <mass_N>
  	<radius_1> <radius_2> ... <radius_N>
  	<flux_1> <flux_2> ... <flux_N>
  	<u1_1> <u1_2> ... <u1_N>
  	<u2_1> <u2_2> ... <u2_N>

  	<a_1> <e_1> <i_1> <o_1> <l_1> <m_1>
  	...
  	<a_(N-1)> <e_(N-1)> <i_(N-1)> <o_(N-1)> <l_(N-1)> <m_(N-1)>

  	where the Keplerian coordinates (a = semimajor axis, e = eccentricity, i = inclination,
  	o = argument periapse, l = nodal longitude, m = mean anomaly) are the
  	N-1 Jacobian coordinates associated with the masses as ordered above.
  	Angles are assumed to be in radians. The observer is along the positive z axis.
  	Rotations are performed according to Murray and Dermott.

	<report_file> file
	-------------------

	This file is a list of times to report the outputs.
  	The first line is a space-separated list of single character-defined
  	output fields according to:

  	t = time
  	F = flux
  	a = semi-major axes
  	e = eccentricities
  	i = sky-plane inclinations
  	o = arguments of periapse
  	l = nodal longitudes
  	m = mean anomalies
  	K = full keplerian osculating elements
  	x = barycentric, light-time corrected coordinates
  	v = barycentric, light-time corrected velocities
  	M = masses
  	E = fractional energy change from t0
  	L = fraction Lz change from t0

  	For example, the first line could be

  		t F E

  	and the output would have three columns of time flux and
  	fractional energy loss.
